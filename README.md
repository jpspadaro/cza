# Original Chirperjax Documentation
A simple 2D platformer game that demonstrates the use of two Rust crates:
[Gate](https://crates.io/crates/gate) and [Collider](https://crates.io/crates/collider).

### Play Online

Thanks to WebAssembly and WebGl, you can play this game online at
<http://www.luduminis.com/chirperjax/>.

### Building

Instructions are the same as building the Gate example app.
See <https://github.com/SergiusIW/gate/tree/master/example>.

***Note: CZA contains a script for moving dependencies and starting a webserver for testing (requires Python) called wasm32_setup.sh (tested for Linux and Macos) for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.***
